Welcome to the CarPi project!

CarPi is a Raspberry Pi project for the car - in particular for old cars that don't have a fancy infotainment system.

CarPi consists of the following components:

* A Raspberry Pi that is powered by the car's battery
* A Mobile app (a Webapp provided by the Raspberry Pi)
* A Server application that lets you access your car from remote locations

The following functions are implemented: 

* CarPi can stream video of a webcam to the smartphone
* CarPi can run your music library using the mopidy music server (https://www.mopidy.com/)
* CarPi provides an in-car WiFi access point for system control and to give passengers Internet access
* CarPi shows the indoor temperature and pressure ("room climate")
* CarPi provides current accelerometer readings (as a basis for an upcoming alarm system)

Currently under construction:

* Trip logging using GPS sensor data
* Status monitor for second car battery
* Alarm system based on accelerometer sensor
